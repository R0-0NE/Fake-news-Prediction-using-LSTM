# Fake-news-Prediction-using-LSTM

## Aim:
The aim of the "Fake-news-Prediction-using-LSTM" project is to develop a machine learning model, specifically utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict whether a given piece of news is real or fake. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are particularly effective for processing and making predictions based on sequences of data, making them well-suited for tasks like natural language processing (NLP).

In this project, the model is trained on a dataset containing examples of both real and fake news articles, along with their corresponding labels indicating their authenticity. The LSTM network learns to analyze the textual content of news articles and make predictions based on patterns and features within the data. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable and accurate classifier that can automatically identify fake news articles, which has significant implications for combating misinformation and promoting media literacy.
